  <h1>A bit about this...</h1>

  <div>
    I started this for 2 reasons:
    <ol>
      <li>I wanted a quick and easy way to track encounters in Dark Heresy games using my phone, on which I'd rather click multiple times than type</li>
      <li>I wanted to get a bit of hands on with Angular Material to see how it stacks up to PrimeNG</li>
    </ol>
  </div>
